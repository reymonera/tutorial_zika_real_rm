# Nextstrain build for Zika virus tutorial

Hi, this is just a taste of how we can start doing our own Nextstrain stuff. I've been following the tutorial and now wanted to see my results as part of the Nextstrain community.

This repository provides the data and scripts associated with the [Zika virus tutorial](https://nextstrain.org/docs/getting-started/zika-tutorial).

See the [original Zika build repository](https://github.com/nextstrain/zika) for more about the public build.
